# Social Old Memories

## Introduction
It is a social media project where we can share our old memories, favorite places or even our
fillings. I implemented authentication using jwt and Google oauth, manual and keyword search,
like, comments, delete post and suggested post. I implemented back-end using nodejs, frontend using react and mongodb for database.

Setup:
-> yarn or npm install
-> yarn start or npm start
